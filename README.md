# VSCODE Spacemacs Theme
## Why?
I **love** the way spacemacs looks, however the intellisense in vscode is better than the emacs/spacemacs one, but why leave behind the coloring?

## What does it looks like?
![Like this](/screenshot.png?raw=true "Screenshot")

## Ok i'm sold how do i try it?
You can find it on VSCode Marketplace
shift+cmd+p + install extension -> search for Spacemacs Theme

**Enjoy!**

I use [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

## TODO
